Flask-admin for inventory of servers
# Dockerized Python flask-admin Application with Prometheus `node_exporter` Configuration

This project consists of a Dockerized Python application along with a Jinja2 template for generating Prometheus `node_exporter` configurations. The Dockerfile is set up to containerize a Python application, and the template is designed to generate job configurations for `node_exporter` based on host information.

## Dockerized Python Application

### Dockerfile

The Dockerfile (`Dockerfile`) in this project is used to create a Docker image for running a Python application. Here's what the Dockerfile does:

1. Uses the official Python 3 base image.
2. Sets up a working directory in the container.
3. Copies the `requirements.txt` file to the container and installs Python dependencies.
4. Copies the application code into the container.
5. Configures the container to run the Python application specified by `CMD`.

You can customize the Dockerfile to suit your specific application requirements, including setting environment variables, exposed ports, and additional configuration.

To build the Docker image, use the following command:

```bash
docker build -t my-python-app .

Certainly! Here's a README file that includes both the Dockerfile setup and the Prometheus node_exporter Jinja2 template documentation:

Prometheus node_exporter Configuration Template
prometheus-node-exporter-config.j2

The prometheus-node-exporter-config.j2 file is a Jinja2 template used to generate job configurations for Prometheus node_exporter. It is intended to be used with the Prometheus configuration file (prometheus.yml) to dynamically generate job configurations based on host information.

Here's how the template works:

    It iterates over a list of hosts.
    For each host, it checks if the group and env attributes are not set to 'unknown'.
    If the condition is met, it generates a job configuration block for the host.
    The generated job configuration includes the job_name set to the host's hostname, targets (typically the host and port where node_exporter is running), and labels (metadata) for the host, such as env, group, type, and infra.

You can customize the template and integrate it into your Prometheus configuration to automate the generation of job configurations for monitoring your infrastructure with node_exporter.
Getting Started

    Build the Docker image for your Python application as shown above.

    Customize the prometheus-node-exporter-config.j2 template to match your host information and Prometheus setup.

    Integrate the template into your Prometheus configuration (prometheus.yml) by rendering it with the necessary data.

    Run both your Python application container and Prometheus with the updated configuration.

    Monitor your infrastructure with Prometheus and node_exporter.
